Title: PARTITIONED SCHEDULING WITH FEWER PROCESSORS

Abstract: We consider the partitioned Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
scheduling of real time periodic tasks on identical multiprocessors in
a multiprocessor. We characterize our task sets by two parameters:
maximum utilization, Umax and the maximum ratio between consecutive
task utilizations, gamma. For a given Umax and gamma we have a
developed a novel method for determining the maximum number of
required processors, M(Umax, gamma).It is guaranteed that any task set
with maximum utilization <= Umax and utilization ratio <= gamma can be
portioned on to M(Umax, gamma) processors. Compared to the current
state of the art, our method requires as much as 35% fewer processors.
