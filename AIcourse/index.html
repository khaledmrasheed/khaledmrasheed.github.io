<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Artificial
Intelligence (AI). The course is appropriate both for nonspecialists
who wish to acquire a general understanding of the field, and for
students preparing for more advanced courses or research in Artificial
Intelligence.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

Familiarity with first-order logic, basic graph representations and
algorithms, complexity and programming.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Goals of the Artificial Intelligence field; Core topics of AI,
including search, knowledge representation, reasoning, planning and
learning; Applications of AI selected from among the following:
machine vision, natural language processing, and robotics; other
advanced topics.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; problem sets; quizzes, two midterms and a final examination.
(Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all problem set
solutions and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Problem Sets:             30 %</a>
<li>Midterm Examinations:     20+20 %</a>
<li>Final Examination:        30 %</a><br>

The above distribution is only tentative and may change later. The
instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Homework Submission Policy</H2> 

Homework must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late homework
will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the instructor
only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with the
university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the AI Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/AIcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/AIcourse/</a>, including
assignments. Announcements may be posted between class meetings.  You
are responsible for being aware of whatever information is posted
there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2> 

<li> Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Russell and 
Norvig, Prentice-Hall, second edition, 2003. (Required.) </a>

<H2>Additional Books</H2> 

<li> Essentials of Artificial Intelligence, Ginsberg, Morgan Kaufmann, 1993.

<li> Artificial Intelligence, Winston, Addison-Wesley, 3rd ed., 1992.</a>

<li> Artificial Intelligence, 2nd Edition, Rich and Knight,
McGraw-Hill, 1990.


<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li>[12-3-2009] The final will be 3:30-6:30pm on Friday December 11th. It
will be in the same classroom in which the lectures met. It will cover
all the topics discussed in the course. It will be open book and notes
but no laptops will be allowed. You should bring a calculator to the
exam. You should also bring your own lecture notes.

<li>[11-2-2009] For Problem set 4, problem 3, part b: You need not
prove that Ellen is not married. This part is now for extra credit. To
do it, you will probably need to use the equality axioms on Page 304
of the text book.

<li>[11-2-2009] The second midterm will be on Thursday 11-12-2009. It
will be open book and open notes. The use of laptops will not be
permitted so please print the lecture notes and bring them with you if
you need them. The lecture on Tuesday 11-10-2009 will be a review
lecture.

<li>[9-16-2009] The first midterm will be on Tuesday 9-29-2009. It
will be open book and open notes. The use of laptops will not be
permitted so please print the lecture notes and bring them with you if
you need them. The lecture on Thursday 9-24-2009 will be a review
lecture.

<li>[9-11-2009] Your Colleague Christopher Jackson found a very nice
site which illustrates lots of concepts in AI.  For example there is a
tool for visually solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems using Arc
Consistency. The tools can be found in http://www.aispace.org.
