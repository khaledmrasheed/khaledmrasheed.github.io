CSCI/ENGR 8940: Solution sketches for Assignment #2


Problem 1:
----------
(a)
Prufer number: 1,2,3,4,5

Causality: The above examples show that small changes in the Prufer
number may result in large changes in the tree structure. The
difference between the Prufer numbers of parts (a) and (b) was in one
position only, but the trees were significantly different. The
difference between the Prufer numbers of parts (c) and (d) was in two
places but only by a unit change each. Again, the trees were
significantly different. In fact, many researchers observed the
causality problem of Prufer numbers. Some of them were considering
organizing a workshop in GECCO'2001 to discuss methods to improve the
causality of tree representations or a similar topic. I don't know if
they will go ahead with it though.

NOTE: The comment is an opinion, thus there is no right or wrong
answer to this part, other comments will be acceptable.

Problem 2:
----------
F1(x)=the number of ones in bit string x 
F2(x)=the number of ones or zeros in bit string x whichever is larger 

(a)

Causality: F2 has better causality. Under F1, if we change one gene
(bit), the fitness will increase or decrease by exactly 1. On the
other hand, under F2 if we change one gene the fitness could increase
by 1 or stay the same or decrease by 1. Thus the expected absolute
change in fitness value under F2 is less than 1.

NOTE: due to the ambiguity in definition of causality, other solutions
may be accepted for full or partial credit.

(b)

Epistasis: F2 suffers more epistasis. Under F2, if we change one gene
(bit) from 0 to 1 say, the fitness could increase by 1 (if the other
genes have more 1s than 0s) or stay the same (if the other genes have
an equal number of 1s and 0s) or even decrease by one (if the other
genes have more 0s than 1s). On the other hand, under F2, if we change
one gene from 0 to 1 the effect will be a unit increase in fitness
regardless of the values of other genes. A similar argument can be
made for changing a gene from 1 to 0.


Problem 3:
-----------
S1=11101111 
S2=00010100
S3=01000011 

H1=1******* 
H2=0******* 
H3=******11 
H4=***0*00* 
H5=1*****1* 
H6=1110**1*

(a)
H1 is matched by S1
H2 is matched by S2 and S3
H3 is matched by S1 and S3
H4 is not matched by any string
H5 is matched by S1
H6 is matched by S1

In other words:
S1 matches schemata H1, H3, H5, H6
S2 matches schema H2
S3 matches schemata H2, H3

(b)
Schema	Order	Defining length	

H1	1	0
H2	1	0
H3	2	1
H4	3	3
H5	2	6
H6	5	6

(c)

The probability of survival of schema Hi=(1-Pm)^o(Hi) where Pm=0.001
and o(Hi) is the order of schema Hi. Thus the probabilities are 0.999,
0.999, 0.998, 0,997, 0.998, 0.995 respectively.

Problem 4:
----------

In this problem the genotype space contains 16 individuals, whose
fitness values span the range 0 to 15.

(a) Schema 1*** is matched by the individuals with fitness values 8+0,
8+1 ... 8+7. Thus, the average fitness = 8+(0+1+2...7)/8 
= 8 + 4*(0+7)/8  (arithmetic series)
= 11.5

(b) Schema 0*** is matched by the individuals with fitness values 0+0,
0+1 ... 0+7. Thus, the average fitness = 0+(0+1+2...7)/8 
= 0 + 4*(0+7)/8  (arithmetic series)
= 3.5

Another solution: The average fitness of schema 0*** = average fitness
of schema 1*** - 8 = 3.5 since the only difference is the first bit
which adds 8 to each fitness value.

(c) Schema ***1 is matched by the individuals with fitness values 1+2*0,
1+2*1 ... 1+2*7. Thus, the average fitness = 1+2*(0+1+2...7)/8 
= 1 + 2* [4*(0+7)/8]  (arithmetic series)
= 8

(d) Schema ***0 differs from ***1 in the last bit position only, which
decreases each fitness value by 1. Thus the average fitness of schema
***0 = 7
