<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms
(GA) and other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global
optimization. To teach students how to apply these methods to solve
problems in complex domains such as Engineering design and
Optimization.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Artificial Intelligence, and  Engineering students who want to
apply AI techniques to solve problems in their fields of study.


<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI/PHIL 4550/6550 Artificial Intelligence (or permission of the
instructor).  Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data
structures and at least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Genetic Algorithm core topics including representation, operators and
architectures. Genetic Algorithm applications in Engineering
optimization including design. Other fields of evolutionary
computation. Other global optimization techniques such as simulated
annealing.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; and term
project and paper.  (Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 25% (Programs, questions, attendance, paper
presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 25%
<li>Final Examination: 25%
<li>Term Project: 25% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<Strong>three</Strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the CI Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/CIcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/CIcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.
