<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

The course aims to provide students with a broad introduction to the
field of Data Mining and related areas and to teach students how to
apply these methods to solve problems in complex domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Data Mining and Machine Learning, as well as Bioinformatics, Science
and Engineering students who want to apply Data Mining techniques to
solve problems in their fields of study.


<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 Data Structures. Familiarity with basic computer algorithms
and data structures. Knowledge of a modern programming language.


<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Data Mining techniques: Selected from: Association and
Classification Rule Mining, Linear Models, Decision Trees and Random
Forests, Neural Network approaches, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian
Learning, Instance-based Learning, Pre-processing and Feature
Selection, Performance evaluation, Ensemble Learning and clustering.

<li>Part II: Data Mining applications: Selected from: Bioinformatics,
Biomedical/Physical/Chemical modeling, medical diagnosis, text/web
mining, pattern recognition and/or other contemporary applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (include running experiments using the Weka
package); paper presentation, two midterms; and term project (may
require programming or running existing packages) and paper. <strong>
Unless otherwise announced by the instructor, all assignments and all
exams must be done entirely on your own.</strong>

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, homeworks, attendance, paper presentation)
<li>Midterm Examinations: 40%   
<li>Term Project: 30% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>FOUR</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline on eLC. Late
assignments will lose 10% for every calendar day. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the DM Class
Home-page at <A HREF="https://khaledmrasheed.github.io/DMcourse/">
https://khaledmrasheed.github.io/DMcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available on eLC and at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2>

(4th edition)", Ian Witten, Eibe Frank , Mark Hall and Christopher Pal. Morgan Kaufmann,
2016. <strong>(Required)</strong><br>
<strong>ISBN-10: 0128042915 & ISBN-13: 978-0128042915 </strong> <br>

<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li> [2-17-2025] The first midterm exam will be on Thursday
2-27-2025. It will cover all the topics discussed in the course till
the end of Chapter 4. It will be open notes
but the use of books, laptops or phones will not be allowed. You
should bring a calculator to the exam; If you do not have a calculator
you may use your phone as a calculator after asking me for permission. You should also bring your
lecture notes and all handouts and you may also bring any additional
notes, homeworks etc.

<!--
<li> [12-4-2017] The course evaluations for CSCI courses are to be done on-line for Fall 2017.  You can access the following URL which will allow you to login into the course evaluation system using your MyID and password:

<A HREF="http://eval.franklin.uga.edu">eval.franklin.uga.edu</A>

The course evaluation system will be on-line till December 7, 12:00AM (finals begin on December 7). Please remember that you will get 1\% extra credit for your total class grade just for doing the evaluations!

<li> [12-4-2017] The course project presentations will be done on
12-12-2017 at the time of the final exam (because there is no final
exam). They will be done from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm with about 15 minutes per
group in Boyd room 208. The course project reports are due on the same
day. For the project report format, please write it as a conference
paper of about 8 two-column pages or 12 single-column pages (there is
no restriction on size though). You should include a title, an
abstract, an introduction, a mention of related work if any, a
description of your experiments and results and a conclusion. In the
introduction or elsewhere in the paper you should describe the domain
that you applied your Data Mining technique(s) to, in enough detail
for the reader to appreciate the significance and difficulty of the
problem. Please bring a hard copy. Please also include your email
addresses as well as the URLs of any demo/supporting web pages. There
is a slight chance that I might contact you soon after the submission
deadline (within 48 hours) requesting codes, clarifications or more
data.

<li> [11-28-2017] The second midterm will be this Thursday
11-30-2017. It will focus on Chapter 5 and the sections of Chapters 7
and 12 that are covered in the lecture notes but please bring all
lecture notes for all chapters with you. It will be open notes but the
use of laptops or phones will not be allowed. You should also bring
your lecture notes and all handouts and you may also bring any
additional notes, homeworks etc.
