<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms
(GA) and other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global
optimization. To teach students how to apply these methods to solve
problems in complex domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.


<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 Data Structures (or permission of the instructor).
Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Genetic Algorithm core topics including representation, operators and
architectures. Other fields of evolutionary computation. Evolutionary
Computation applications in science and Engineering. Other global
optimization techniques such as simulated annealing.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper (for graduate students only).  (Unless otherwise
announced by the instructor: all assignments and all exams must be
done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, attendance, paper
presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 30%
<li>Undergraduates: Final Examination: 40%
<li>Graduates: Final Examination 10% And Term Project: 30% (includes
term paper and presentation)

<br>


Graduate students may work on their term projects individually or in
groups of TWO students each. The above distribution is only tentative
and may change later. The instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the CI Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2> 

<li> "Evolutionary Computation", D. Dumitrescu et al. CRC Press,
2000. (Required.) </a>

<H2>Additional Books</H2> 

<li> "Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine
Learning", David Goldberg. Addison-Wesley, 1989.

<li> "An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms", Melanie Mitchell. MIT
Press, 1996.
 
<li> "Genetic Algorithms + Data Structures = Evolution Programs",
Zbigniew Michalewicz. Springer-Verlag, New York,1996.


<H2>Announcements:</H2> 

<li> 12-10-2001: The final exam will be on Thursday, December 13th. It
will be open book open notes. It will cover all what we studied in the
course with the exceptions I mentioned in class which are the guest
lectures, the multiobjective GA lecture and the last two chapters in
the text book. Classifier systems are to be studied from the handout I
gave in class (which includes the GIL classifier system) and may be
part of the exam.

<li> 12-10-2001: The soluion sketches for assignment 4 are posted below.

<li> 10-23-2001: A very nice paper about crossover methods for
permutations (like the PMX crossover) can be found in
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/318951.html. To download the full paper you
should use the download section at the top right corner of the
page. You can get the paper in several different formats. You can also
download it from www.sc.ehu.es/ccwbayes/postscript/aireview00.ps.gz
