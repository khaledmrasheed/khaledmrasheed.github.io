<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms
(GA) and other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global
optimization. To teach students how to apply these methods to solve
problems in complex domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.


<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 Data Structures (or permission of the instructor).
Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Genetic Algorithm core topics including representation, operators and
architectures. Other fields of evolutionary computation. Evolutionary
Computation applications in science and Engineering. Other global
optimization techniques such as simulated annealing.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper (for graduate students only).  (Unless otherwise
announced by the instructor: all assignments and all exams must be
done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, attendance, paper
presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 30%
<li>Undergraduates: Final Examination: 40%
<li>Graduates: Final Examination 10% And Term Project: 30% (includes
term paper and presentation)

<br>


Graduate students may work on their term projects individually or in
groups of TWO students each. The above distribution is only tentative
and may change later. The instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the CI Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2> 

<li> "Evolutionary Computation 1", Thomas Back et al. IOP Publishing,
2000. (Required.) </a>

<H2>Additional Books</H2>

Learning", David Goldberg. Addison-Wesley, 1989.

<H2>Announcements:</H2> 

<li> 12-15-2002: For the project report please write it as a
conference paper of about 8 pages (there is no restiction on size
though). You should include an introduction, a mention of related
work, a description of your experiments and results and a
conclusion. In the introduction or elsewhere in the paper you should
describe the domain that you applied your EC technique(s) to, in
enough detail for the reader to appreciate the significance and
difficulty of the problem. The reports are due on Monday by 5 PM.
