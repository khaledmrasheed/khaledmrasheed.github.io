<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which is
concerned with computer programs that can automatically improve their
capabilities and/or performance by acquiring (learning) experience.
The main objectives of this course are to provide students with an
in-depth introduction to machine learning theory and methods
and an exploration of research problems in machine learning and its
applications which may lead to work on a project or a dissertation.

The course is intended primarily for computer science and artificial
intelligence graduate students. Graduate students from other
departments who have a strong interest and sufficient experience in
artificial intelligence may also find the course interesting.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI/PHIL 4550/6550 Artificial Intelligence or CSCI 4560/6560
Evolutionary Computation (or permission of the instructor).
Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Machine learning techniques: Selected from inductive learning,
decision trees, neural network approaches, evolutionary computation
approaches and classifier systems, reinforcement learning, statistical
and Bayesian learning, instance-based learning, explanation-based
learning and computational learning theory.

<li>Part II: Machine learning applications: Selected from data mining,
medical diagnosis, fraud detection, pattern recognition and/or other
contemporary applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (may include programming and/or running existing
programs); midterm; and term project and paper.  (Unless otherwise
announced by the instructor: all assignments and all exams must be
done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, attendance, paper
presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 30% (open book and notes)
<li>Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>three</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the ML Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2> 

<li> "Machine Learning", Tom Mitchell.  McGraw-Hill, 1997. (Required.) 

<H2>Additional Books</H2> 

<li> "Data Mining", Ian Witten & Eibe Frank. Morgan Kaufmann, 2000.

<li> "Evolutionary Computation : Towards a New Philosophy of Machine
Intelligence", David Fogel. IEEE press, 1999.

<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li> 5-1-2002: This is a reminder that the project presentations will
be this Friday from noon to 3 PM. Each group should plan on a 15
minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of Q&A. You should prepare
your own slides as I cannot guarantee to be able to make them for you
(exam week, professors making copies of final exams...etc.). All
members of the group should take part in the presentation which should
follow the same guidelines for the paper presentations you did.

<li> 5-1-2002: For your final reports, you have a lot of
freedom. There are no size limitations but I suggest you aim for 8
pages double column (regular conference paper size). Just don't forget
the main components of a paper, including:

<ul>
<li> An abstract which very briefly summarizes what you did (one or
two paragraphs).
<li> Problem description: enough to appreciate the difficulty and
importance of the problem you solved.
<li> ML technique(s) used. You should also justify choosing these
techniques and compare to a straw man or other techniques if possible.
<li> Related work: to show that you did not duplicate something that
has been done before and that you are aware of the state of the art
(not much is required, one or two papers will do).
<li> Clear description of experiments, results and discussion.
<li> Conlclusion, which includes future work that you think would be
promising for you or someone else to do.
</ul>

Please submit your final report by 5 PM next Monday. You should email
me an electronic version (Postscript, PDF or Ms. Word) and also bring
a hardcopy to my office by the deadline. I will invite some of you to
create conference papers out of your course projects later.

<li> 4-25-2002: Assignment 5 is posted below. It is due on 5-3-2002
in class.
