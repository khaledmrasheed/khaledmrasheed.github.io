<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which is
concerned with computer programs that can automatically improve their
capabilities and/or performance by acquiring (learning) experience.
The main objectives of this course are to provide students with an
in-depth introduction to machine learning theory and methods
and an exploration of research problems in machine learning and its
applications which may lead to work on a project or a dissertation.

The course is intended primarily for computer science and artificial
intelligence graduate students. Graduate students from other
departments who have a strong interest and sufficient experience in
artificial intelligence may also find the course interesting.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI/PHIL 4550/6550 Artificial Intelligence or CSCI 4560/6560
Evolutionary Computation (or permission of the instructor).
Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Machine learning techniques: Selected from inductive learning,
decision trees, neural network approaches, evolutionary computation
approaches and classifier systems, reinforcement learning, statistical
and Bayesian learning, instance-based learning, explanation-based
learning and computational learning theory.

<li>Part II: Machine learning applications: Selected from data mining,
medical diagnosis, fraud detection, pattern recognition and/or other
contemporary applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (may include programming and/or running existing
programs); midterm; and term project and paper.  (Unless otherwise
announced by the instructor: all assignments and all exams must be
done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 25% (Programs, homewrks, paper presentation)
<li>Midterm Examination: 25%  
<li>Final Examination: 25% 
<li>Term Project: 25% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>three</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the ML Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2> 

<li> "Machine Learning", Tom Mitchell.  McGraw-Hill, 1997. (Required.) 

<H2>Additional Books</H2> 

<li> "Data Mining", Ian Witten & Eibe Frank. Morgan Kaufmann, 2000.

<H2>Announcements:</H2> 
<li> [5-1-2003] For the project report please write it as a
conference paper of about 8 pages (there is no restiction on size
though). You should include an introduction, a mention of related
work, a description of your experiments and results and a
conclusion. In the introduction or elsewhere in the paper you should
describe the domain that you applied your ML technique(s) to, in
enough detail for the reader to appreciate the significance and
difficulty of the problem. The reports are due during the final exam.

<li> [4-29-2003] All scores are posted <A

your scores are properly recorded. The scores do not include the fifth
homework assignment and the Neural Net extra credit. I hope to add
these and repost the scores by Thursday.

<li>[4-22-2003] I posted all your paper presentations below. I also
posted the last assignment, which is due on Tuesday 4-29.
