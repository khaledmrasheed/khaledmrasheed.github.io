<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Artificial
Intelligence (AI). The course is appropriate both for nonspecialists
who wish to acquire a general understanding of the field, and for
students preparing for more advanced courses or research in Artificial
Intelligence.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

Familiarity with first-order logic, basic graph representations and
algorithms, complexity and at least one high level programming
language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Goals of the Artificial Intelligence field; Core topics of AI,
including search, knowledge representation, reasoning, planning and
learning; Applications of AI selected from among the following:
machine vision, natural language processing, robotics and cognitive
modeling; other advanced topics.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; problem sets; quizzes, two midterms and a final examination.
(Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all problem set
solutions and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Problem Sets:             30 %</a>
<li>Midterm Examinations:     20+20 %</a>
<li>Final Examination:        30 %</a><br>

The above distribution is only tentative and may change later. The
instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Homework Submission Policy</H2> 

Homework must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late homework
will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the instructor
only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with the
university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the AI Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/AIcourse/">
http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/AIcourse/</a>, including
assignments. Announcements may be posted between class meetings.  You
are responsible for being aware of whatever information is posted
there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2> 

<li> Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Russell and 
Norvig, Prentice-Hall, second edition, 2003. (Required.) </a>

<H2>Additional Books</H2> 

<li> Essentials of Artificial Intelligence, Ginsberg, Morgan Kaufmann, 1993.

<li> Artificial Intelligence, Winston, Addison-Wesley, 3rd ed., 1992.</a>

<li> Artificial Intelligence, 2nd Edition, Rich and Knight,
McGraw-Hill, 1990.


<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li> 12-6-2004: The final will be 12-3pm on Thursday December 16th. It
will be in the same classroom in which the lectures meet. It will cover
all the topics discussed in the course. It will be open book and notes
but no laptops will be allowed. You should bring a calculator to the
exam. You should also bring your own lecture notes.

<li> 12-1-2004: I decided NOT to allow the use of laptops in the
second midterm (or the final) as this could lead to considerable
distraction. Instead, you are encouraged to print the lecture notes
and bring them with you. I will bring several copies of the lecture
notes for the lectures covered by the second midterm to the classroom
tomorrow. If you cannot print your own lecture notes you can borrow
them from me. From what I observed, most of you already have the
lecture notes for all the lectures. In preparation for the midterm you
are encouraged to review the material from the lecture notes and the
book as well as the homework problems and the problems discussed in
class. I will be available in my office from 2pm to 4pm today in case
you have any questions.

<li> 11-18-2004: The second midterm will be on December 2nd. It will
be open book and open notes. It will cover the parts that were not
covered by the first midterm up till today's lecture (game playing,
logic and planning).

<li> 10-14-2004: The projected grades and all scores are posted <A
HREF="2004_CSCI_6550_4550.txt">HERE</A>. Please make sure that all
your scores are properly recorded. If your projected grade is C or
lower, I strongly advise you to come and see me tomorrow or Friday. I
will be available in my office tomorrow from 2 to 3 p.m. in additional
to my office hours on Friday.
