<H2>Prerequisite:</H2> 
Prerequisite: CSCI 1301-1301L. (Strickly enforced)

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2>
The fundamental mathematical tools used in computer science: sets,
relations, and functions; propositional logic, predicate logic, and
inductive proofs; summations, recurrences, and elementary asymptotics;
counting and discrete probability; graphs and trees; introductory
linear algebra, with applications in computer science.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 
Reading; homework assignments; two midterm exams; and final. All
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your
own. Attendance in all lectures is expected. You are responsible for
all material taught in class even if you are absent and it is not in
the book. Attendance in the two midterms is mandatory with no
possibility for makeup exams.

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 
All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<li>Midterm Examinations: 20% each
<li>Undergraduates: Final Examination: 30%


<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 
Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline in class. Late

instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.
