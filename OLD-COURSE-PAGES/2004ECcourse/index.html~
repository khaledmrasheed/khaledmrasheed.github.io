<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms
(GA) and other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global
optimization. To teach students how to apply these methods to solve
problems in complex domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 Data Structures (or permission of the instructor).
Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Genetic Algorithm core topics including representation, operators and
architectures. Other fields of evolutionary computation. Evolutionary
Computation applications in science and Engineering. Other global
optimization techniques such as simulated annealing.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper.  (Unless otherwise
announced by the instructor: all assignments and all exams must be
done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of
honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The
penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an
acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, paper presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%
<li>Final Examination: 25%
<li>Term Project: 25% (includes term paper and presentation)

<br>

Students may work on their term projects individually or in groups of
up to THREE students each. The above distribution is only tentative
and may change later. The instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the EC Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

Smith. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2003. (Required)

<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li> 12-3-2004: Remember that the last homework assignment is due next
Monday. You should bring the homework to class IN PERSON. We shall not
have a lecture next Tuesday as Friday classes will be meeting then. We
shall have a review lecture on Thursday and that will be the last day
of classes.

<li> 11-22-2004: The fifth homework assignment is posted below and is
due on 12-6-2004. 

<li> 11-22-2004: We shall start our paper presentations tomorrow so
please sign up for a paper presentation before its too late. Each
presentation will be 15 minutes including questions and answers. You
can present in any format you like. Keep in mind that you are
presenting from an evolutionary computation point of view. You need
not spend too much time describing the application domain (just enough
for us to appreciate that it is a significant problem). Also remember
to offer your own opinion about the paper at the end of your
presentation.

<li> 11-9-2004: Due to the evacuation of Boyd GSRC today, the lecture
was not held. The homework deadline is now Thursday 11-11 instead of
today. I will not be holding office hours on Friday as I shall be out
of town but I will hold office hours tomorrow from 1:30 to 3:30 pm
instead.

<li> 10-13-2004: The projected grades and all scores are posted <A
HREF="2004_CSCI_6560_4560.txt">HERE</A>. Please make sure that all
your scores are properly recorded. If your projected grade is C or
lower, I strongly advise you to come and see me tomorrow or Friday. I
will be available in my office tomorrow from 2 to 3 p.m. in addition
to my office hours on Friday.
