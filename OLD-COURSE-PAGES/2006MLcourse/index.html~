<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which is
concerned with computer programs that can automatically improve their
capabilities and/or performance by acquiring (learning) experience.
The main objectives of this course are to provide students with an
in-depth introduction to machine learning theory and methods
and an exploration of research problems in machine learning and its
applications which may lead to work on a project or a dissertation.

The course is intended primarily for computer science and artificial
intelligence graduate students. Graduate students from other
departments who have a strong interest and sufficient experience in
artificial intelligence may also find the course interesting.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI/PHIL 4550/6550 Artificial Intelligence or CSCI 4560/6560
Evolutionary Computation (or permission of the instructor).
Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Machine learning techniques: Selected from inductive
learning, decision trees, neural network approaches, evolutionary
computation approaches and classifier systems, reinforcement learning,
statistical and Bayesian learning, instance-based learning,
explanation-based learning and computational learning theory.

<li>Part II: Machine learning applications: Selected from data mining,
biomedical modelling, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, pattern
recognition and/or other contemporary applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (may include programming and/or running existing
programs); midterm; term project and paper.  (Unless
otherwise announced by the instructor: all assignments and all exams
must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="http://www.uga.edu/ovpi/academic_honesty/culture_honesty.htm">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, homeworks, attendance, paper presentation)
<li>Midterm Examination: 30%  
<li>Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>three</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the ML Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/">
http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore</H2> 

<li> "Machine Learning", Tom Mitchell.  McGraw-Hill, 1997. (Required.) 

<H2>Additional Books</H2> 

<li> "Data Mining", Ian Witten & Eibe Frank. Morgan Kaufmann, 2000.

<H2>Announcements:</H2> 

<li>4-25-2005: For the project report please write it as a conference
paper of about 8 pages (there is no restiction on size though). You
should include an introduction, a mention of related work, a
description of your experiments and results and a conclusion. In the
introduction or elsewhere in the paper you should describe the domain
that you applied your ML technique(s) to, in enough detail for the
reader to appreciate the significance and difficulty of the
problem. The reports are due during the final exam. Please bring a
hard copy to the final and followup by email so I can post it on this
page for your fellow students.

<li>3-5-2006: The projected grades and all scores are posted <A

your scores are properly recorded. Also the fourth homework assignment
is posted below.
