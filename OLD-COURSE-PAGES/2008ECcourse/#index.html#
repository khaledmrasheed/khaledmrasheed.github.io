<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms and
other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global optimization. To
teach students how to apply these methods to solve problems in complex
domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 Data Structures (or permission of the instructor).
Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Genetic Algorithm core topics including representation, operators and
architectures. Other fields of evolutionary computation including
Genetic Programming, Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming
and Classifier Systems. Evolutionary Computation applications in
science and Engineering. Other nature-inspired global optimization techniques.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper.  (Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, paper presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%
<li>Final Examination: 25%
<li>Term Project: 25% (includes term paper and presentation)

<br>

Students may work on their term projects individually or in groups of
up to THREE students each. The above distribution is only tentative
and may change later. The instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the EC Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there. 

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Announcements:</H2> 

<li>[12-5-2008]: The project report should look like a conference
paper of about 8 two-column pages in small font or 20 single-column
pages in large font (there is no restiction on size though). You
should include an introduction, a mention of related work, a
description of your experiments and results and a conclusion which may
include limitations and/or future work. For application oriented
projects, don't forget to describe the domain that you applied your EC
technique(s) to, in enough detail for the reader to appreciate the
significance and difficulty of the problem. The reports are due during
the final exam. Please bring a hard copy to the final.


<li>[11-28-2008] The project status report presentations will be done
on December 4th which would be the last lecture of the course. There
will be no grade assigned for the status report itself but it is a
very important part of the course project. All members of each project
group should take part in the presentation. You should use this
opportunity to discuss what your goal are, what had been accomplished,
what remains to be done and most importantly what problems you are
facing. In previous semesters many good ideas were proposed and good
advice was given by your fellow students as well as the
instructor. These status reports have been very helpful to me in
grading the final project reports as well.
