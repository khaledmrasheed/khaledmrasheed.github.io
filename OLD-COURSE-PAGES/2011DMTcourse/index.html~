<H2>Prerequisites:</H2> 
MATH 1113, CSCI 1301-1301L. (Strictly enforced)

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2>
The fundamental mathematical tools used in computer science: sets,
relations, and functions; propositional logic, predicate logic, and
inductive proofs; summations, recurrences, and elementary asymptotics;
counting and discrete probability; graphs and trees; introductory
linear algebra, with applications in computer science.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 
Reading; homework assignments; four hourly exams; and final. All
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your
own. Attendance in all lectures is expected. You are responsible for
all material taught in class even if you are absent and it is not in
the book. Attendance in the hourly exams is mandatory with no
possibility for makeup exams.

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 
All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defence.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 15% (homeworks and attendance)
<li>Hourly Examinations: 60% 
<li>Final Examination: 25%


<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 
Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline in class. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

The Class Home-page is at <A
HREF="http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/">
http://www.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/DMcourse/</a>. Materials including
announcements, handouts, lecture notes and assignments will be posted
there. Announcements may be posted between class meetings.  You are
responsible for being aware of whatever information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Textbook in Bookstore (Required)</H2> 

<strong><a
href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072880082/information_center_view0/">Discrete
Mathematics and its Applications</a></strong>, by Kenneth
H. Rosen.<br> McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math<strong>, 6th
Edition<br></strong><b>ISBN-10:</b> 0073312711<br> <b>ISBN-13:</b>
978-0073312712.<br> The book has an excellent companion <strong><a

student learning center</a></strong>.

<H2>Announcements:</H2> 

<li> [3-31-2011] The third exam will be on Wednesday April 13th. It
will cover Chapters 3 and 4. Only the sections and topics disscussed
in class will be included. The exam is closed book closed notes.

<li> [3-10-2011] The due date for Homework 6 has been extended to
Thursday 3-24. Your projected letter grades will be emailed to you
some time next week.

<li> [3-5-2011] The second exam will be on Wednesday March 9th. It
will cover Chapter 2 and Boolean Algebra (Chapter 11 in the regular
text and 10 in some international editions. Only the first three
sections of the Boolean Algebra chapter are covered). The exam is
closed book closed notes. Please bring a calculator to the exam. Also
the lecture on Tuesday will include a review of the homework and other
problems in preparation for the exam.

<li> [3-5-2011] The TA's office hour next week only will be held on
Wednesday from 2:20pm to 3:20pm.

<li> [3-2-2011] Please note that there is a difference between the
regular text book and one of the international editions (the black and
white one). There is one missing chapter in that international
edition. As a result, Boolean Algebra is chapter 10 rather than 11 in
that international edition. The sections and the problems are the same
though.

<li> [2-24-2011] Starting next week, attendance may be taken at any
lecture and it will affect homework grades.
