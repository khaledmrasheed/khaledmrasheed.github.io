<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms and
other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global optimization. To
teach students how to apply these methods to solve problems in complex
domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 1302 Software Development. Familiarity with basic computer
algorithms and data structures and at least one high level programming
language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Genetic Algorithm core topics including representation, operators and
architectures. Other fields of evolutionary computation including
Genetic Programming, Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming
and Classifier Systems. Evolutionary Computation applications in
science and Engineering. Other nature-inspired global optimization techniques.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper.  (Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, paper presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%
<li>Undergraduates: Final Examination: 50%
<li>Graduates: Final Examination 25% And Term Project: 25% (includes
term paper and presentation)

<br>

Term projects are required for graduate students and optional for
undergraduates. If any undergraduates choose to do term projects,
their grade distribution will be the same as that of graduate
students. Students may work on their term projects individually or in
groups of up to THREE students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the EC Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there. 

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Announcements:</H2> 

<li> [12-6-2011]: The project report should look like a conference
paper of about 8 two-column pages in small font or 20 single-column
pages in large font (there is no restiction on size though). You
should include an introduction, a mention of related work, a
description of your experiments and results and a conclusion which may
include limitations and/or future work. For application oriented
projects, don't forget to describe the domain that you applied your EC
technique(s) to, in enough detail for the reader to appreciate the
significance and difficulty of the problem. The reports are due during
the final exam. Please bring a hard copy to the final.

<li> [12-6-2011] The final will be 3:30-6:30pm on Tuesday December
13th. It will be in the same classroom in which the lectures met. It
will cover all the topics discussed in the course. It will be open
book and notes but no laptops will be allowed. You should bring a
calculator to the exam. You should also bring your own lecture
notes. One of the questions will be about a paper presented in
class. Copies of that paper will be provided for you in the exam so
you need not print them.


<li>[12-6-2011] My office hours this week will be tomorrow (Wednesday)
from 2:30pm to 5pm. I shall post more information regarding course
project reports and the final exam shortly.

<li>[11-10-2011] It is important that you sign up to present a paper
next week if you have not presented or signed up already. The paper
presentations are an important part of the course. they carry the same
weight as a programming assignment. Besides, Homework 6 is about
critiques of papers. Finally, One of the questions on the final exam
will be about one of the papers presented in class (copies of that
paper will be provided in the final).

<li>[10-5-2011] The midterm exam will be next Tuesday
[10-11-2011]. The exam will be open book and notes and will cover all
topics discussed in class up to and including Chapter 6 of the text
book. All handouts given in class are part of the curriculum and it is
your responsibility to study them as well. Please bring a calculator
to the exam. Tomorrow we will have a review lecture.
