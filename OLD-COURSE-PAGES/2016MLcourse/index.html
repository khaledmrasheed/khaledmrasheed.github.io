<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which is
concerned with computer programs that can automatically improve their
capabilities and/or performance by acquiring (learning) experience.
The main objectives of this course are to provide students with an
in-depth introduction to machine learning theory and methods
and an exploration of research problems in machine learning and its
applications which may lead to work on a project or a dissertation.

The course is intended primarily for computer science and artificial
intelligence graduate students. Graduate students from other
departments who have a strong interest and sufficient experience in
artificial intelligence may also find the course interesting.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 4380/6380 Data Mining or CSCI/PHIL 4550/6550 Artificial
Intelligence or CSCI 4560/6560 Evolutionary Computation (or permission
of the instructor).  Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and
data structures and at least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Machine learning techniques: Selected from inductive
learning, decision trees, neural network approaches, evolutionary
computation approaches and classifier systems, reinforcement learning,
statistical and Bayesian learning, instance-based learning, ensemble
learning and computational learning theory.

<li>Part II: Machine learning applications: Selected from data mining,
bioinformatics, biomedical modeling, medical diagnosis, text
classification, pattern recognition and/or other contemporary
applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Attendance; reading; assignments (some include programming and/or
running existing programs); two midterms; and term project and paper.

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/culture_honesty.htm">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Group Study Policy:</H2>

Group study is a powerful resource for graduate students and is
therefore encouraged. During group study, you may discuss in detail
any homework problems.  However, you must write or type your
homework on your own. Furthermore, you should never look at or copy
a complete solution to a problem from another student's homework or
allow another student to look at or copy a complete problem solution
from your homework.  Finally, you should acknowledge group study by
listing the names of the students you studied with at the beginning or
end of your homework. <Strong>Participation in group study is
optional and will not affect your grade in any way.</Strong>

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 20% (Programs, homeworks, attendance, paper presentation)
<li>Midterm Examinations: 40%   
<li>Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>four</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the ML Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li>[5-2-2016] The course project presentations will be this Thursday,
5-5-2016 from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm in the same room where the class met
during the semester. Please plan for a 15 minute presentation per
project group, focusing on the results. All members of the project
group should take part in the presentation.

<li>[5-2-2016] The course project reports are due by email on
Tuesday, 5-10-2016 by 5 pm. For the project report format, please
write it as a conference paper of about 8 two-column pages or 12
single-column pages (there is no restriction on size though). You
should include a title, an abstract, an introduction, a mention of
related work if any, a description of your experiments and results and
a conclusion. In the introduction or elsewhere in the paper you should
describe the domain that you applied your ML technique(s) to, in
enough detail for the reader to appreciate the significance and
difficulty of the problem. Please also include your email addresses as
well as the URLs of any demo/supporting web pages. There is a slight
chance that I might contact you soon after the submission deadline
(within 48 hours) requesting codes, clarifications or more data.

<li> [4-23-2016] The second midterm will be this upcoming Thursday
4-28-2016. The exam will be open notes. It will focus on the topics
not covered by the first midterm but there may be some references to
early topics. The topics include Chapters 6, 7 and 8 of the text book
and the handouts about SVM, Combining multiple models and evolutionary
computation. You should bring your lecture notes, handouts and any
homeworks or notes you anticipate using in the exam. As I mentioned in
class, the midterm with higher score will receive more weight than the
one with lower score for each student.

<li> [3-14-2016] The first midterm exam will be tomorrow 3-15-2016 in
class 3:30-4:45pm. It will cover all the topics discussed in the
course up to Chapter 6 Page 180. It will be open notes but the use of
books or laptops will not be allowed. You should bring your lecture
notes and all handouts and you are encouraged to also bring any
additional notes, homeworks etc.
