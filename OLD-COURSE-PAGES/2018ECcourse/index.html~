<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms and
other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global optimization. To
teach students how to apply these methods to solve problems in complex
domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 1302 Software Development. Familiarity with basic computer
algorithms and data structures and at least one high level programming
language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Components of an Evolutionary Algorithm, Genetic Algorithms, Evolution
Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Programming, Learning
Classifier systems, Parameter Control, Multi-modal Problems,
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization, Hybridization and Memetic
Algorithms, Working With Evolutionary Algorithms, Theory of
Evolutionary Computation, Evolutionary Computation applications in
science and Engineering. Other nature-inspired global optimization
techniques.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper.  (Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Course Objectives and Expected Outcomes:</H2>

This course presents a survey of topics in evolutionary computation.
At the end of the semester, all students are expected to be able to do
the following:
<br>

<li>Formulate a problem as an evolutionary computation
search/optimization by specifying representations, selection and
variation operators.
<li>Write a program or use a package to implement an evolutionary algorithm.
<li>Conduct evolutionary optimization experiments and properly report
and discuss the results.
<li>Effectively present an evolutionary computation article to an audience.
<li>Review and critique evolutionary computation articles.
<li>Reason about the schema theorem and the theory of evolutionary computation.


<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, paper presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%
<li>Undergraduates: Final Examination: 50%
<li>Graduates: Final Examination 25% And Term Project: 25% (includes
term paper and presentation)

<br>

Term projects are required for graduate students and optional for
undergraduates. If any undergraduates choose to do term projects,
their grade distribution will be the same as that of graduate
students. Students may work on their term projects individually or in
groups of up to Four students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the EC Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there. 

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of <strong>some</strong> of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be
available at the bottom of the class home page. Not all the lectures
will have electronic notes though and the students should be prepared
to take notes inside the lecture at any time.

<H2>Announcements:</H2>

 <li> [12-1-2018] As announced in class, the final exam will be on
Tuesday 12-11-2018 3:30-6:30pm. It will be in Dawson Hall room 306. It
will cover all the topics discussed in the course but more focus will
be given to the topics that were not covered by the midterm starting
from Chapter 6 and including all handouts. It will be open notes but
the use of laptops or phones will not be allowed except that you can
use your phone as a calculator if needed. You should also bring your
own lecture notes and all handouts. One of the questions will be about
a paper presented in class. Copies of that paper will be provided for
you in the exam so you need not print any of them. We shall have our
review lecture on Monday. Please bring your answers to Homework 5 with
you, as we shall go through the solutions as well as some previous
final exam questions.

<li> [12-1-2018] The course project report should look like a
conference paper of about 8 two-column pages or 12 single-column pages
(there is no restriction on size though). You should include a title,
an abstract, an introduction, a mention of related work if any, a
description of your experiments and results and a conclusion which may
include limitations and/or future work. For application oriented
projects, don't forget to describe the domain that you applied your EC
technique(s) to, in enough detail for the reader to appreciate the
significance and difficulty of the problem. <strong>Please bring the
printed reports with you to the final exam on 12-11-2018.</strong>
This is a HARD deadline. Also please include your emails in the report
just in case I need some clarifications, code or data.

<li> [10-2-2018] The midterm exam will be next Tuesday 10-9-2018. It
will cover all the topics discussed in the course till the end of
Chapter 5. It will be open notes but the use of books, laptops or
phones will not be allowed. You should bring a calculator to the
exam. You should also bring your lecture notes and all handouts and
you may also bring any additional notes, homeworks etc. We shall have
a review lecture this Thursday.
