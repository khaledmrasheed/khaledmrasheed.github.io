<H2>COVID-19 Note:</H2> 

Due to COVID-19, the following is the format I am planning to use
unless the situation changes. I will do the lecture in person in room
208 and up to 15 of you can attend in person with your masks
on. Please check your email and reply to my request for your
preference of attendance day (Monday or Tuesday or Thursday). The
lecture will simultaneously be a Zoom meeting and will be recorded and
posted online on the same day. Those who do not attend in person can
join the zoom meeting (i.e. synchronously), which will enable them to
ask questions and participate in the discussions or wait and review
the recording later (i.e. asynchronously). Attendance in class will
not be mandatory.</BR>

<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms and
other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global optimization. To
teach students how to apply these methods to solve problems in complex
domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 or CSCI 2725 Data Structures. Students must have a good
understanding of basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Components of an Evolutionary Algorithm, Genetic Algorithms, Evolution
Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Programming, Learning
Classifier systems, Parameter Control, Multi-modal Problems,
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization, Hybridization and Memetic
Algorithms, Working With Evolutionary Algorithms, Theory of
Evolutionary Computation, Evolutionary Computation applications in
science and Engineering. Other nature-inspired global optimization
techniques.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper.  (Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Course Objectives and Expected Outcomes:</H2>

This course presents a survey of topics in evolutionary computation.
At the end of the semester, all students are expected to be able to do
the following:
<br>

<li>Formulate a problem as an evolutionary computation
search/optimization by specifying representations, selection and
variation operators.
<li>Write a program or use a package to implement an evolutionary algorithm.
<li>Conduct evolutionary optimization experiments and properly report
and discuss the results.
<li>Effectively present an evolutionary computation article to an audience.
<li>Review and critique evolutionary computation articles.
<li>Reason about the schema theorem and the theory of evolutionary computation.


<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, paper presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%
<li>Final Examination: 20%
<li>Term Project: 30% (includes
term paper and presentation)

<br>

Term projects are required from all students. Students may work on
their term projects individually or in groups of up to FIVE students
each. The above distribution is only tentative and may change
later. The instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the EC Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there. 

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be available at the bottom
of the class home page. Not all the lectures will have electronic
notes though and the students should be prepared to take notes inside
the lecture at any time.

  <H2>Announcements:</H2>
  
<li> [11-30-2020] The final exam will be on Monday 12-14-2020
3:30-6:30pm. It will be online using the quiz function of eLC like the
midterm. It will cover all the topics discussed in the course but more
focus will be given to the topics that were not covered by the midterm
starting from Chapter 6. It will be open book and notes. One of the
questions will be about a paper presented in class. That paper will be
provided for you in the exam on eLC.

<li> [11-30-2020] The course project report should look like a
conference paper of about 8 two-column pages or 12 single-column pages
(there is no restriction on size though). You should include a title,
an abstract, an introduction, a mention of related work if any, a
description of your experiments and results and a conclusion which may
include limitations and/or future work. For application oriented
projects, don't forget to describe the domain that you applied your EC
technique(s) to, in enough detail for the reader to appreciate the
significance and difficulty of the problem. <strong>Please email the
reports to me by 12-17-2020.</strong>  This is a HARD deadline. Also
please include your preferred email addresses in the report just in
case I need some clarifications, code or data.
