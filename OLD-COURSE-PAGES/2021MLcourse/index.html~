<H2>COVID-19 Note:</H2> 

Due to COVID-19, the following is the format I am planning to use
unless the situation changes. I will do the lecture in person in room
208 and up to 15 of you can attend in person with your masks
on. Please check your email and reply to my request for your
preference of attendance day (Monday or Tuesday or Thursday). The
lecture will simultaneously be a Zoom meeting and will be recorded and
posted online in eLC on the same day. Those who do not attend in person can
join the zoom meeting (i.e. synchronously), which will enable them to
ask questions and participate in the discussions or wait and review
the recording later (i.e. asynchronously). Attendance in class will
not be mandatory.</BR>

<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which is
concerned with computer programs that can automatically improve their
capabilities and/or performance by acquiring (learning) experience.
The main objectives of this course are to provide students with an
in-depth introduction to machine learning theory and methods
and an exploration of research problems in machine learning and its
applications which may lead to work on a project or a dissertation.

The course is intended primarily for computer science and artificial
intelligence graduate students. Graduate students from other
departments who have a strong interest and sufficient experience in
artificial intelligence may also find the course interesting.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 4380/6380 Data Mining or CSCI/PHIL 4550/6550 Artificial
Intelligence or CSCI 4560/6560 Evolutionary Computation (or permission
of the instructor).  Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and
data structures and at least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Machine learning techniques: Selected from inductive
learning, decision trees, neural network approaches, evolutionary
computation approaches and classifier systems, statistical and
Bayesian learning, instance-based learning, feature selction and
extraction, ensemble learning and computational learning theory.

<li>Part II: Machine learning applications: Selected from data mining,
bioinformatics, biomedical modeling, medical diagnosis, text
classification, visual pattern recognition and/or other contemporary
applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Attendance; reading; assignments (some include programming and/or
running existing programs); midterm exam; and term project and paper.

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Group Study Policy:</H2>

Group study is a powerful resource for graduate students and is
therefore encouraged. During group study, you may discuss in detail
any homework problems.  However, you must write or type your
homework on your own. Furthermore, you should never look at or copy
a complete solution to a problem from another student's homework or
allow another student to look at or copy a complete problem solution
from your homework.  Finally, you should acknowledge group study by
listing the names of the students you studied with at the beginning or
end of your homework. <Strong>Participation in group study is
optional and will not affect your grade in any way.</Strong>

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 20% (includes homeworks, programming or using packages)
<li>Paper presentation: 10%
<li>Paper reviews: 10%
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%   
<li>Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>four</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in through eLC by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will loose 10% for every calendar day. Rare exceptions may
be made by the instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in
accordance with the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the ML Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes and Zoom lectures will be
available at the course eLC page.

<H2>Announcements:</H2>

<li> [3-16-2021] The midterm exam will be this Thursday 3-18-2021
during lecture time. It will be online using the quiz function of
eLC. It will cover all the topics discussed in the course except for
Deep Learning which we started today. It will be open book, notes and
Zoom lectures. However, you are not allowed to contact anyone by any
means except to call me if you have a clarification question. You
should not do any internet search or run any ML package or code during
the exam. The exam is 75 minutes with a 10 minute grace period. You can
answer each question using the eLC editor or write the answers on a
piece of paper, scan it and upload the file. If you encounter a
problem with eLC please email me your answers before the end of the
  grace period.

<li>[3-21-2021] When you prepare your paper presentation, please refer
to the first set of lecture notes which can be found on eLC, file
name: CSCI_8950_Lec1_Course_Overview, Slide #16 for instructions. In
addition, please remember to cite any sources from which you obtained
slides, figures or any other material for the presentation. Doing so
will not decrease your grade in any way. However, not reporting your
sources will be a violation. You can refer to any of the lecture notes
to see how I cited sources. You can acknowledge all sources on the
title slide or at the bottom of specific slides. Finally, your
presentation should be 25 minutes except when given permission to
exceed that. A presentation that is too short or too long will loose
points. If your paper is short you can augment it with useful
background/related information or discussions.
