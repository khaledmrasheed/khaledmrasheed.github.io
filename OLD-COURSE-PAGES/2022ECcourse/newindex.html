<H2>COVID-19 Note:</H2> 

I will do the lecture in person (face to face) in room 208 and all
students are expected to attend unless you are sick or under
quarentine. In such cases please email me and I can work with you by
zoom to catch up.</BR>
 
Face coverings: Following guidance from the University System of
Georgia, face coverings are recommended for all individuals while
inside campus facilities.</BR>

How can I obtain the COVID-19 vaccine?  University Health Center is
scheduling appointments for students through the UHC Patient Portal
(https://patientportal.uhs.uga.edu/login_dualauthentication.aspx).
Learn more here https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-vaccine.</BR>

The Georgia Department of Health, pharmacy chains and local providers
also offer the COVID-19 vaccine at no cost to you. To find a COVID-19
vaccination location near you, please go to:
https://georgia.gov/covid-vaccine.</BR>

In addition, the University System of Georgia has made COVID-19 vaccines available at 15 campuses statewide and you can locate one here: https://www.usg.edu/vaccination</BR>

What do I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?  Students showing COVID-19
symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an appointment with the
University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8
a.m.-5p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies and after-hours
care, see, https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.</BR>

What do I do if I test positive for COVID-19?  If you test positive
for COVID-19 at any time, you are required to report it through the
DawgCheck Test Reporting Survey. We encourage you to stay at home if
you become ill or until you have excluded COVID-19 as the cause of
your symptoms.  UGA adheres to current Georgia Department of Public
Health (DPH) quarantine and isolation guidance and requires that it be
followed. Follow the instructions provided to you when you report your
positive test result in DawgCheck.</BR>

Guidelines for COVID-19 Quarantine Period (As of 8/1/21; follow
DawgCheck or see DPH website for most up-to-date recommendations)
Students who are fully vaccinated do not need to quarantine upon
exposure unless they have symptoms of COVID-19 themselves. All others
should follow the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH)
recommendations:</BR>

Students who are not fully vaccinated and have been directly exposed
to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should self-quarantine for 10
days. Those quarantining for 10 days must have been symptom-free
throughout the monitoring period and continue self-monitoring for
COVID-19 symptoms for a total of 14 days. You should report the need
to quarantine on DawgCheck (https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/), and
communicate directly with your faculty to coordinate your coursework
while in quarantine. If you need additional help, reach out to Student
Care and Outreach (sco@uga.edu) for assistance.</BR>


<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

To provide a broad introduction to the field of Genetic Algorithms and
other fields of Evolutionary Computation and global optimization. To
teach students how to apply these methods to solve problems in complex
domains.

The course is appropriate both for students preparing for research in
Evolutionary Computation, as well as Science and Engineering students
who want to apply Evolutionary Computation techniques to solve
problems in their fields of study.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 2720 or CSCI 2725 Data Structures. Students must have a good
understanding of basic computer algorithms and data structures and at
least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

Components of an Evolutionary Algorithm, Genetic Algorithms, Evolution
Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Programming, Learning
Classifier systems, Parameter Control, Multi-modal Problems,
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization, Hybridization and Memetic
Algorithms, Working With Evolutionary Algorithms, Theory of
Evolutionary Computation, Evolutionary Computation applications in
science and Engineering. Other nature-inspired global optimization
techniques.

<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Reading; assignments (including programming); midterm; final; and term
project and paper.  (Unless otherwise announced by the instructor: all
assignments and all exams must be done entirely on your own.)

<H2>Course Objectives and Expected Outcomes:</H2>

This course presents a survey of topics in evolutionary computation.
At the end of the semester, all students are expected to be able to do
the following:
<br>

<li>Formulate a problem as an evolutionary computation
search/optimization by specifying representations, selection and
variation operators.
<li>Write a program or use a package to implement an evolutionary algorithm.
<li>Conduct evolutionary optimization experiments and properly report
and discuss the results.
<li>Effectively present an evolutionary computation article to an audience.
<li>Review and critique evolutionary computation articles.
<li>Reason about the schema theorem and the theory of evolutionary computation.


<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 30% (Programs, questions, paper presentations)
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%
<li>Final Examination: 20%
<li>Term Project: 30% (includes
term paper and presentation)

<br>

Term projects are required from all students. Students may work on
their term projects individually or in groups of up to FIVE students
each. The above distribution is only tentative and may change
later. The instructor will announce any changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Rare exceptions may be made by the
instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in accordance with
the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the EC Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/ECcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there. 

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be available at the bottom
of the class home page. Not all the lectures will have electronic
notes though and the students should be prepared to take notes inside
the lecture at any time.
