<H2>COVID-19 Note:</H2> 

I will do the lecture in person (face to face) in room 208 and all
students are expected to attend unless you are sick or under
quarantine. In such cases please email me and I can work with you by
zoom to catch up.</BR>
 <p>
Face coverings: Following guidance from the University System of
Georgia, face coverings are recommended for all individuals while
inside campus facilities.</BR>
<p>
How can I obtain the COVID-19 vaccine?  University Health Center is
scheduling appointments for students through the UHC Patient Portal
(https://patientportal.uhs.uga.edu/login_dualauthentication.aspx).
Learn more here https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-vaccine.</BR>
<p>
The Georgia Department of Health, pharmacy chains and local providers
also offer the COVID-19 vaccine at no cost to you. To find a COVID-19
vaccination location near you, please go to:
https://georgia.gov/covid-vaccine.</BR>
<p>
In addition, the University System of Georgia has made COVID-19 vaccines available at 15 campuses statewide and you can locate one here: https://www.usg.edu/vaccination</BR>
<p>
What do I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?  Students showing COVID-19
symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an appointment with the
University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162 (Monday-Friday, 8
a.m.-5p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies and after-hours
care, see, https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies.</BR>
<p>
What do I do if I test positive for COVID-19? (Isolation
Guidance)  If you test positive for COVID-19 at any time, either
through a PCR test, an Antigen test, or a home test kit, you are
required to report it through the DawgCheck Test Reporting
Survey. Follow the instructions provided to you when you report your
positive test result in DawgCheck.
<p>
As of December 29, 2021, when an individual receives a positive
COVID-19 test: Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, should:
<li> Stay home for 5 days.
<li> If you have no symptoms or your symptoms are resolving after 5
days, you can leave your house and return to class.
<li>Continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days.
<p>
What do I do if I have been exposed to COVID-19? (Quarantine guidance)
If you have been exposed (within 6 feet for a cumulative total of 15
minutes or more over a 24-hour period unmasked.) to someone with
COVID-19 or to someone with a positive COVID-19 test and you are:</br>

<li>Boosted, or have become fully vaccinated within the last 6 months
  (Moderna or Pfizer vaccine) or within the last 2 months (J&J
  vaccine):</br> You do not need to quarantine at home and may come to
  class. You should wear a mask around others for 10 days. If
  possible, get tested on day 5. If you develop symptoms, get tested
  and isolate at home until test results are received, then proceed in
  accordance with the test results.

<li>Unvaccinated, or became fully vaccinated more than
6 months ago (Moderna or Pfizer vaccine) or more than 2 months ago
  (J&J vaccine) and have not received a booster:</br>
You must quarantine at home for 5 days. After that you may return to class but continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days. If possible, get
tested on day 5. If you develop symptoms, get tested and isolate at
home until test results are received, then proceed in accordance with
  the test results.</br>

** “Masked-to-masked” encounters are not currently
considered an exposure; this type of interaction would not warrant
quarantine.</br>
 <p>
You should report the need to quarantine on DawgCheck
(https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/), and communicate directly with your
faculty to coordinate your coursework while in quarantine. If you need
additional help, reach out to Student Care and Outreach (sco@uga.edu)
for assistance.

<H2>Objectives:</H2> 

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which is
concerned with computer programs that can automatically improve their
capabilities and/or performance by acquiring (learning) experience.
The main objectives of this course are to provide students with an
in-depth introduction to machine learning methods
and an exploration of research problems in machine learning and its
applications which may lead to work on a project or a dissertation.

The course is intended primarily for computer science and artificial
intelligence graduate students. Graduate students from other
departments who have a strong interest and sufficient experience in
artificial intelligence may also find the course interesting.

<H2>Recommended Background:</H2> 

CSCI 4380/6380 Data Mining or CSCI/PHIL 4550/6550 Artificial
Intelligence or CSCI 4560/6560 Evolutionary Computation (or permission
of the instructor).  Familiarity with basic computer algorithms and
data structures and at least one high level programming language.

<H2>Topics to be Covered:</H2> 

<li>Part I: Machine learning techniques: Selected from inductive
learning, decision trees, neural network approaches, evolutionary
computation approaches and classifier systems, statistical and
Bayesian learning, instance-based learning, feature selction and
extraction, ensemble learning and deep learning.

<li>Part II: Machine learning applications: Selected from data mining,
bioinformatics, biomedical modeling, medical diagnosis, text
classification, visual pattern recognition and/or other contemporary
applications.


<H2>Expected Work:</H2> 

Attendance; reading; assignments (some include programming and/or
running existing programs); midterm exam; and term project and paper.

<H2>Academic Honesty and Integrity:</H2> 

All academic work must meet the standards contained in <A
HREF="https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/">
"A Culture of Honesty."</A> Students are responsible for informing
themselves about those standards before performing any academic
work. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance
is not an acceptable defense.

<H2>Group Study Policy:</H2>

Group study is a powerful resource for graduate students and is
therefore encouraged. During group study, you may discuss in detail
any homework problems.  However, you must write or type your
homework on your own. Furthermore, you should never look at or copy
a complete solution to a problem from another student's homework or
allow another student to look at or copy a complete problem solution
from your homework.  Finally, you should acknowledge group study by
listing the names of the students you studied with at the beginning or
end of your homework. <Strong>Participation in group study is
optional and will not affect your grade in any way.</Strong>

<H2>Grading Policy:</H2> 

<li>Assignments: 20% (includes homeworks, programming or using packages)
<li>Paper presentation: 10%
<li>Paper reviews: 10%
<li>Midterm Examination: 20%   
<li>Term Project: 40% (includes term paper and presentation)
<br>

Students may work on their term projects in groups of up to
<strong>four</strong> students each. The above distribution is only
tentative and may change later. The instructor will announce any
changes.

<H2>Assignment Submission Policy</H2> 

Assignments must be turned in through eLC by the assigned deadline. Late
assignments will loose 10% for every calendar day. Rare exceptions may
be made by the instructor only under extenuating circumstances and in
accordance with the university policies.

<H2>Course Home-page</H2> 

A variety of materials will be made available on the ML Class
Home-page at <A HREF="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/">
http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~khaled/MLcourse/</a>, including handouts,
lecture notes and assignments. Announcements may be posted between
class meetings.  You are responsible for being aware of whatever
information is posted there.

<H2>Lecture Notes</H2>

Copies of Dr. Rasheed's lecture notes will be available at the course eLC page.
